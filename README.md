# Factorial Addition Function

This repository contains my solution to the coding challenge provided by First Fence. The challenge was to create a factorial addition function as efficiently as possible, and I have provided ample comments in the code to explain my thinking and reasoning.

## Approach

To solve the challenge, I implemented the factorial addition function with careful consideration of performance and efficiency. The code is well-documented, providing insights into the logic and steps involved in the solution.

## Testing

I have included basic tests using the built-in `assert` function in Node.js to verify the functionality of the factorial addition function. These tests ensure that the code works as expected and produces the correct results.
